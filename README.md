- 👋 Hi, I’m @alm2036
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning Projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hadoop, PySpark and Scala.
- I have interest in writing my master's thesis in one of the 3 topics "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering, or OpenAI API, or Large Language Model," which will demonstrate my ability to tackle complex problems and contribute original insights to the field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Machine Learning (in particular Artificial Intelligence in HealthCare).
